# Iris-Classification
Iris Classification using k-NN algorithm
This project is an example of using the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to classify the species of iris flowers.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which consists of 150 samples of iris flowers. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The flowers are classified into three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.
Implementation
The code uses the k-NN algorithm to classify the species of iris flowers based on their features. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a k-NN classifier with k=1 is trained on the training set. The trained model is then used to make predictions on the testing set, and the accuracy of the model is calculated using the accuracy_score function from scikit-learn.
The code also includes an example of how to use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

Libraries Used
The following libraries were used in this project:
•	numpy
•	pandas
•	matplotlib

•	scikit-learn

Files
The following files are included in this project:
•	Iris.csv: The dataset file in CSV format
•	iris_classification.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook file containing the code used in this project

Usage
To run the code in this project, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official website.
Once you have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can open the iris_classification.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to execute the code.
